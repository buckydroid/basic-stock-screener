# Basic Stock Screener

This is a very basic stock screener that goes through each stock symbols of the sp500 and checks for some fundamental and technical data to filter out suitable stocks.

And yeah, 

I have also added an option to do the same for Indian stocks using Yahoo Finance api. But it's just NIFTY, so it's not possible to find suitable stocks all the time.
